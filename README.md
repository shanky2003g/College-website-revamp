Introduction:

    I'm Shashank Gupta, a second-year undergraduate student in the IT department.
    I've been working on a revamp for our department's website.

Accessing the Website:

    You can easily view the revamped website by opening the "index.html" file, the main webpage.

UI/UX Design:

    I've put a lot of effort into creating a simple, attractive, and appealing user interface (UI/UX).

Engaging Features:

    I've added engaging features such as image sliding for a more interactive experience.

Feedback Form:

    I've integrated a feedback form that uses Firebase to store user-entered data accurately in our database.

Hosting on Netlify:

    I've hosted the website on Netlify, and you can access the live version using this link:https://6537d4edefe18500810f06b5--bespoke-croissant-f1b7bd.netlify.app/
